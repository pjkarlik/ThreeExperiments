# ThreeJS Experiments

  My current THREE.js experiments and demos set up with a base sky light box and reflection/refraction maps. Currently getting some warnings but still renders.. texture issues..

  TODO:// Cleaning up default code, next to do some model loading and management.

  index.js points to => ObjectMaterials.js (current testbed for textures and animations)

## Change Log
  * Simplex Noise Demo - Just rough draft for now, learning Three.js after p5js WebGl... http://threeboilerplate-simplex.surge.sh
  * SKYBOXES!!!!! - From http://www.humus.name/index.php?page=Textures - A good healthy choice of settings!
  * Initial Commit - basic render and canvas elements.

## Run the example
  Requires Node v7.0.0 or greater

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev & open http://localhost:2020
```
